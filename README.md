**How to Use:**  
- Open `index.html` in any modern browser (or visit the live link above).  
- Tweak parameters in the on-screen control panel (Particles, G, speed, etc.) and click **Reset** to apply.

**Screenshot:**  
Place a file named `screenshot.png` (e.g. a capture of the running sim) in the repo root so that it appears above.
